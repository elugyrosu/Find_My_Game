Soon, it was revealed that her name was Silk, the same name that Ms. Silk had, and that she was a trapped mage that was cursed to travel through alternate dimensions, never being able to return to her homeworld. Silk has informed Takuya and the couple that she needs a large amount of female elemental nature life energy to power up the spell that would return her to her own dimension, so she wants of Takuya to go out and seduce various women around him in order to gather the necessary sexual energy. To assist him in this task she has enchanted him with superhuman charism that will allow him to woo any women he desires. \n \nAnd so Takuya's ordinary life became ordinary no more.",

As a dark elven sorceress, you travel through a vast world, fighting monsters and completing quests in the search for your missing mentor. \n \nLightslayer was my first commercial game, originally released in the year 2000, almost 20 years ago. This is version 3, which I have upgraded for newer computers. Changes include: \n \n  OpenGL-accelerated rendering. \n  Run at the native full screen resolution, or in a resizeable window. \n  Full mouse support, in the menus and the actual game. \n  A few minor user interface and game balance improvements. \n  The original Wrath of Darkness game included as a bonus. \n \nHowever, the actual content of the game is untouched, in all of its primitive programmer-art glory. Overall, I think this game has held up incredibly well to the test of time, which is another way of saying that the ugly and clunky aspects of the game were already ugly and clunky when the game was first released.",
